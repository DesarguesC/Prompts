A gentle breeze blew，rustling the leaves of the tall elm trees and sending the scent of the nearby flowers through the air.In the distance，a row of colorful hot air balloons could be seen rising slowly into the sky，their occupants waving to the townsfolk below. On the other side of the river，a group of friends were gathered for a birthday picnic，sharing food and stories while a nearby flock of swans gracefully glided on the river.
